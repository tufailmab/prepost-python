In the context of Octopus (a multi-objective optimization framework):
The code is taking the output of a particular Pareto front generation (from a run of Octopus), which is stored in a text file.
Each line in the file represents a value of an objective (F1, F2, F3) or the generation diversity (GD).
It cleans the data, organizes every 4 values into a single solution (row), and builds a structured DataFrame for analysis.
Then it computes min, max, and mean for each objective across the generation, which is useful for understanding the spread and quality of the Pareto solutions.

Finally, it saves both the full data and the summary statistics to Excel, so you can include the stats in a paper or further analyze the full Pareto set.
